- simple terminal UI

- DNS
- TCP
- TLS
- HTTP 1/2/3
- certificate expiry

check whether all mutex locks are done correctly
show status per ip
custom useragent
in "DialContext" has it tried to resolve the domain itself, or only after that? (e.g. try to prevent useless dns resolves that might cause issues)
if screen is too small --> scrollbar?
update screen on state update (instead of every 10th second)
add icmp ping
add udp quic test
better ipv4/ipv6 sort algo
durl keep re-testing continuously (reloading, +latency)
recursively fetch certificate hostnames
Cloudflare domains (are more likely to fail http/3, unjustified)
add --debug
http response, show text extract / title
redirect --> blue, optionally follow it / re-run on redirected url
only spin if actually doing something with it, when not started the test yet, just show gray dot
if skipping other tests because of failing tcp, don't show failed but grey(?)
if failing tcp, still check other http/3 (quic (udp))
indicate failing dns using TUI
reduce code duplication
verbose env var / -v
properly discover http3 port
switch from bubbletea to own TUI implementation?
async, parallel, update the UI live
cleanup code
purposely following redirects (and seperately analyzing them)
show ips in list even if no tests ran yet?
ui indicate running
what about the host not even supporting ipv6 at all
hmm..? 2025/10/26 22:46:19 failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 7168 kiB, got: 416 kiB). See https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes for details.
SSLv3?
center ui, with max height and width
some servers to actually test the working of this, similar to badssl, but then badhttp ig
add http 1.0
if not the same across all tls versions, show a table of http version support per tls version
also test http, not just https
more detailed tls handshake failure handling,
https://badssl.com/
considering https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zmap/zcrypto, https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls (?)
things similar to ssllabs.com
own recursive resolver https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver
or something similar to paepcke.de/dnsresolver
and what about DNSSEC? (https://nsmith.net/go-dns-resolver)
and TTL
ALPN for http/3?
purposefuly skip and keep track of dns cache

follow redirects

DNS prefetch, preconnect hint, early hint
websocket upgrade

ip changes
sudden protocol changes
TLS config changes
