- simple terminal UI

- DNS
- TCP
- TLS
- HTTP 1/2/3
- certificate expiry


verbose env var / -v
properly discover http3 port
switch from bubbletea to own TUI implementation?
async, parallel, update the UI live
cleanup code
accidentally following redirects?
purposely following redirects (and seperately analyzing them)
show ips in list even if no tests ran yet?
ui indicate running
what about the host not even supporting ipv6 at all
hmm..? 2025/10/26 22:46:19 failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted: 7168 kiB, got: 416 kiB). See https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Buffer-Sizes for details.
SSLv3?
center ui, with max height and width
some servers to actually test the working of this, similar to badssl, but then badhttp ig
add http 1.0
if not the same across all tls versions, show a table of http version support per tls version
also test http, not just https
more detailed tls handshake failure handling,
https://badssl.com/
considering https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zmap/zcrypto, https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls (?)
things similar to ssllabs.com
own recursive resolver https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver
or something similar to paepcke.de/dnsresolver
and what about DNSSEC? (https://nsmith.net/go-dns-resolver)
and TTL
ALPN for http/3?
